2. Measure popularity and satisfaction: review volume and average rating per book.
3. Identify key publishers excluding short books (< 50 pages).
4. Estimate the average quality of authors with significant evidence (≥ 50 ratings per book).
5. Evaluate user behavior among highly active reviewers (users who rated > 50 books).

### How to view
